#  How to scan images, lookup tables and time measurement with OpenCV
## https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/da5/tutorial_how_to_scan_images.html

Goal

We'll seek answers for the following questions:

    -How to go through each and every pixel of an image?
    -How is OpenCV matrix values stored?
    -How to measure the performance of our algorithm?
    -What are lookup tables and why use them?
